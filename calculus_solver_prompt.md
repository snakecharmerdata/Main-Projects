# Prompt to Recreate Calculus Solver GUI

Create a Python desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to:

- Input a mathematical function (in natural or SymPy notation).
- Convert natural math notation (like `x^2`, `sin x`, `e^x`) to SymPy/Python notation.
- Compute and display the derivative or indefinite integral of the function, showing all solution steps in LaTeX-rendered format.
- Plot the original function and its derivative or integral on a graph.
- Clear all input and output fields.
- Provide a user guide with usage instructions and example equations.

Use Tkinter for the GUI, SymPy for symbolic math, and Matplotlib for plotting. Render LaTeX steps as images within the GUI. Include tooltips and a scrollable area for solution steps. The app should be user-friendly and visually organized.
