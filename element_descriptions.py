Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant chemical element in the universe, 
constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter. It has the symbol H and atomic 
number 1. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, 
odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible gas.

Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid-base reactions because most 
acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons (H+ ions) between soluble molecules.
In the universe, hydrogen mainly exists in its plasma state, whose properties are 
quite different from those of atomic hydrogen.

Applications:
- Hydrogen is used in the production of ammonia for fertilizer
- Used as a clean fuel source with only water as a byproduct when burned
- Used in fuel cells to generate electricity
- Liquid hydrogen is used as a rocket fuel
- Used in the chemical industry to make methanol and hydrochloric acid
